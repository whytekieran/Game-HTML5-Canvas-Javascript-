**IMPORTANT:** This game has been primarily tested on Google Chrome and therefore i would recommend it as your browser of choice to run the game. This game also contains Javascript classes, a fairly new concept to javascript and yet to be fully standardized. Therefore some older browsers may not run it yet. Again i recommend a recent version of Google Chrome.</br>
